      <h3>Backstory</h3>
      <p>
        Born from the molten heart of a dying volcano, Emberdeep is the guardian of the deepest caverns of the world. Infused with the soul of the inferno itself, he is the living embodiment of fire and destruction. As the Flamebound Warden, his task is to prevent the world from being consumed by the very flames that gave him life. His body is etched with ancient runes, glowing with embers that burn with relentless fury. Clad in molten armor, he strikes fear into those who dare seek the secrets of the deep caverns.
